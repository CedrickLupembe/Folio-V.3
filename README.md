### 🚨 **Forking this repo (please read!)**
---
I get a lot of messages from people asking me if they can use this code for their own website, and the answer to that question is usually yes, but with attribution.

I value keeping my site open source, but as you all know, plagiarism is bad. It's always disheartening whenever I find that someone has copied my website without giving me credit. I've put significant effort into building and designing this iteration of my website, and I'm proud of it! All I ask of you all is not to claim this effort as your own.
